# Comprehensive Proof and Explanation of the Parking Rectangle Algorithm

This document provides a unified and comprehensive explanation of the algorithm that generates parking rectangles on both sides of a street. It covers the mathematical foundations, geometric interpretations, error analysis, implementation constraints, and validation procedures.

## 1. Introduction

The algorithm generates parking rectangles on both sides of a street segment using the street's center coordinates, orientation, and desired rectangle dimensions. The generated rectangles are aligned with the street and positioned symmetrically about the street's center line. This document rigorously proves the algorithm's correctness and analyzes its limitations, specifically addressing the approximations made when treating the Earth's curved surface as a locally flat plane.

## 2. Definitions and Parameters

### 2.1 Input Parameters

- **Street Center Point (v):**  `v = [v_lat, v_lon]` (latitude, longitude in decimal degrees). Represents the midpoint of the street segment.
- **Street Orientation (θ):** Angle in radians, measured clockwise from true north, representing the street's direction at the center point.
- **Rectangle Dimensions (B):** `B = [K, H, W]` where:
    - `K`: Perpendicular distance from the street center line to the nearer edge of the rectangle (meters). This is the offset from the centerline.
    - `H`: Height of the rectangle along the street direction (meters). Represents the length of the parking space.
    - `W`: Width of the rectangle perpendicular to the street direction (meters). Represents the width of the parking space.

### 2.2 Coordinate Systems

1. **Geographic Coordinates (Geodetic):** Latitude and longitude (decimal degrees), referenced to the Earth's ellipsoid (e.g., WGS 84). This system accounts for the Earth's curvature.

2. **Local Cartesian Coordinates (East-North-Up - ENU):** A right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the street center point `v`.
    - **X-axis (East):**  Points East.
    - **Y-axis (North):** Points North.
    - **Z-axis (Up):** Points vertically upwards, perpendicular to the ellipsoid surface at the origin.

    This system approximates the local area around `v` as a flat plane, simplifying calculations. Distances are measured in meters.

## 3. Core Transformations

### 3.1 Geographic Normalization (G)

This transformation converts distances in meters (in the local Cartesian system) to changes in latitude and longitude (in the geographic coordinate system). It linearizes the relationship between distance and angular displacement locally around `v`.

```
G = [[1/g_lat, 0],
     [0, 1/g_lon]]
```

where:

```
g_lat = R_lat * (π / 180)
g_lon = R_lon * cos(v_lat * π / 180) * (π / 180)
```

-   `R_lat` is the meridian radius of curvature at `v_lat` (meters per radian).
-   `R_lon` is the prime vertical radius of curvature at `v_lat` (meters per radian).
-   The factor (π / 180) converts degrees to radians.

**Derivation:** This uses the approximation that a small change in latitude (Δlat) corresponds to a distance along the meridian of `R_lat * Δlat` (in radians). Similarly, a small change in longitude (Δlon) corresponds to a distance along the parallel of `R_lon * cos(v_lat) * Δlon` (in radians). The cosine term accounts for the convergence of meridians towards the poles.

**Note:** This definition of `G` is the inverse of the one provided in the original text. The inverse is more directly applicable to converting meters to degrees. Also, using the radius of curvature is more precise than the Haversine function.

### 3.2 Rotation Transform (R(θ))

This matrix rotates coordinates in the local Cartesian system by an angle `θ` counter-clockwise. This aligns the rectangles with the street's orientation.

```
R(θ) = [[cos(θ), -sin(θ)],
       [sin(θ), cos(θ)]
```

### 3.3 Vertex Template Matrix (M)

This matrix defines the vertices of a *template* rectangle with unit width and height, centered at the origin of the local Cartesian system, *before* scaling and offset:

```
M = [[-W/2, K],
     [-W/2, K+H],
     [W/2, K+H],
     [W/2, K]]
```

**Explanation:** Each row represents a vertex (x, y). `K` offsets the rectangle from the origin along the Y-axis (North). This is crucial for placing the rectangle adjacent to the street center line rather than centered on it.

## 4. Algorithm Steps

1. **Base Rectangle Generation:**
   - Multiply `M` by the scaling factors [W, H] to create a rectangle with the desired width and height.
   - Create the base vertices by directly substituting the `K`, `H`, and `W` values into the `M` matrix:
    ```
    V_base = [[-W/2, K],
              [-W/2, K+H],
              [W/2, K+H],
              [W/2, K]]
    ```

2. **Coordinate Transformations:**
   - **Rotation:** Apply the rotation matrix `R(θ)` to align the rectangle with the street's direction:
     `V_rotated = V_base * R(θ)^T` (2x4 matrix, note the transpose of R(θ) for matrix multiplication)
   - **Geographic Conversion:** Apply the geographic normalization matrix `G` to convert the rotated coordinates from meters to degrees:
     `V_geo = V_rotated * G^T` (2x4 matrix, note the transpose of G)

3. **Final Rectangle Generation:**
   - **First rectangle (R₁):**  Translate the geographically normalized vertices by adding the street center coordinates `v`:
     `R₁ = V_geo + v` (element-wise addition, broadcasting `v`)
   - **Second rectangle (R₂):**  Generate the symmetric rectangle by rotating the `V_rotated` vertices by 180 degrees (multiplying by -1) *before* applying the geographic conversion and translation. This is equivalent to:
     `R₂ = -V_rotated * G^T + v`

## 5. Proof of Correctness

### 5.1 Invariants and Properties

- **Shape Preservation:** The rotation matrix `R(θ)` is orthogonal, preserving distances and angles within the local Cartesian system. This ensures the rectangle's shape is maintained during rotation.
- **Offset:** The parameter `K` in the `V_base` matrix ensures the rectangle is offset from the street center line by the desired distance.
- **Symmetry:** The generation of `R₂` by rotating `V_rotated` by 180 degrees guarantees that `R₁` and `R₂` are symmetric with respect to the street center point `v` and aligned with the street orientation `θ`.
- **Orientation:**  The rotation matrix `R(θ)` correctly aligns the rectangles with the specified street orientation.

### 5.2 Error Analysis

The primary source of error is the **planar approximation** used by the local Cartesian coordinate system. The Earth is not flat, and representing a region using a 2D Cartesian plane introduces distortions.

- **Error Magnitude:** The error is proportional to the square of the distance from the center point `v`. The error can be approximated as:

    ```
    ε(d) ≈ d^2 / (2 * R_earth)
    ```

    where `d` is the distance from the center point `v` and `R_earth` is the Earth's radius (approximately 6371 km).

- **Impact:** For small distances (e.g., `|K|`, `H`, `W` < 50m), the error is typically negligible (< 0.2 meters). However, the error increases significantly for larger distances or at higher latitudes where the convergence of meridians is more pronounced.

- **Mitigation:**
    - **Segmentation:** For long streets, divide the street into smaller segments and apply the algorithm to each segment's center point. This reduces the distance `d` and minimizes the error.
    - **Iterative Refinement:** Use the output rectangles as an initial guess and iteratively refine them using more accurate geodetic calculations (e.g., Vincenty's formulae).

## 6. Implementation Constraints and Considerations

- **Numerical Stability:**  Ensure that `H` and `W` are not excessively small (e.g., > 1e-6 meters) to avoid numerical issues. Similarly, `|K|` should be within a reasonable range (e.g., < 100 meters) to keep the planar approximation valid.
- **Geographic Limitations:** The algorithm is most accurate at lower latitudes and for smaller regions. The error increases as the latitude approaches the poles due to the increasing convergence of meridians. Consider using alternative projections or more sophisticated algorithms for high-latitude applications.
- **Singularities:** At the poles, the longitude becomes undefined, and the algorithm may produce unpredictable results. Special handling is required for locations near the poles.
- **Data Quality:** The accuracy of the results depends heavily on the quality of the input data (street center coordinates, orientation). Errors in the input data will propagate through the algorithm.
- **Choice of G:** The formulas provided for `g_lat` and `g_lon` assume an ellipsoidal Earth model. Using the simplified Haversine formula, as presented in the original version, can introduce further inaccuracies. For greater precision, consider utilizing a library or package that provides functions for calculating the radius of curvature based on a specific Earth ellipsoid (e.g., WGS 84).

## 7. Validation and Testing

- **Visual Inspection:** Plot the generated rectangles on a map and visually verify their position, orientation, and symmetry.
- **Numerical Verification:** Compare the calculated coordinates of the rectangle vertices with expected values based on known inputs.
- **Unit Testing:** Create a suite of unit tests with various input parameters (including edge cases) to ensure the algorithm produces correct results under different conditions.
- **Comparison with Ground Truth:** If possible, compare the generated rectangles with real-world measurements of parking spaces to assess the accuracy of the algorithm.
